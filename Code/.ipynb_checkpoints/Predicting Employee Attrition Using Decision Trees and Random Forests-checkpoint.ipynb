    "This final model above using random forests has overall better scores than both our baseline and resampled models, but is still not accurate or precise enough to be used when making real-world decisions. Overhauling both hiring and retention techniques costs time and money - time and money that might be wasted if the above model predicts either false positives or false negatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good starting point for upper leadership and/or human resources staff at any organization to evaluate whether they are effectively hiring and retaining their employees. However, results can further improve by collecting better data, further tuning models, and using more rigorous technologies such as neural networks to predict employee attrition."
